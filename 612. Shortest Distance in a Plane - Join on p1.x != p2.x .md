Input: 
Point2D table:
+----+----+
| x  | y  |
+----+----+
| -1 | -1 |
| 0  | 0  |
| -1 | -2 |
+----+----+
Output: 
+----------+
| shortest |
+----------+
| 1.00     |
+----------+
Explanation: The shortest distance is 1.00 from point (-1, -1) to (-1, 2).

```
The distance between two points `p1(x1, y1)` and `p2(x2, y2)` is `sqrt((x2 - x1)2 + (y2 - y1)2)`.

Write an SQL query to report the shortest distance between any two points from the Point2D table. Round the distance to two decimal points.


```
with a as(
    select *,
        concat(x,' ', y) as pair
    from Point2D
)

select
    round(min(sqrt(power((x1 - x2),2) + power((y1 - y2),2))),2) as shortest
from(
    select p1.x x1, p1.y y1, p2.x x2, p2.y y2
    from a p1
    left join a p2 on p1.pair != p2.pair
    #在join的时候, 可以选择 on !=, 匹配的是左右两table中内容不一样的rows, 以便计算两个不同点之间的距离
) as b 
```
