#### Report Contiguous Dates

Table: `Failed`
```
+--------------+---------+
| Column Name  | Type    |
+--------------+---------+
| fail_date    | date    |
+--------------+---------+
fail_date is the primary key for this table.
This table contains the days of failed tasks.
```

Table: `Succeeded`
```
+--------------+---------+
| Column Name  | Type    |
+--------------+---------+
| success_date | date    |
+--------------+---------+
success_date is the primary key for this table.
This table contains the days of succeeded tasks.
```

A system is running one task every day. Every task is independent of the previous tasks. The tasks can fail or succeed.

Write an SQL query to generate a report of `period_state` for each continuous interval of days in the period from `2019-01-01` to `2019-12-31`.

period_state is 'failed' if tasks in this interval failed or 'succeeded' if tasks in this interval succeeded. Interval of days are retrieved as `start_date` and `end_date`.

Return the result table ordered by `start_date`.

#### Example

```
Input: 
Failed table:
+-------------------+
| fail_date         |
+-------------------+
| 2018-12-28        |
| 2018-12-29        |
| 2019-01-04        |
| 2019-01-05        |
+-------------------+
Succeeded table:
+-------------------+
| success_date      |
+-------------------+
| 2018-12-30        |
| 2018-12-31        |
| 2019-01-01        |
| 2019-01-02        |
| 2019-01-03        |
| 2019-01-06        |
+-------------------+
Output: 
+--------------+--------------+--------------+
| period_state | start_date   | end_date     |
+--------------+--------------+--------------+
| succeeded    | 2019-01-01   | 2019-01-03   |
| failed       | 2019-01-04   | 2019-01-05   |
| succeeded    | 2019-01-06   | 2019-01-06   |
+--------------+--------------+--------------+

```


#### Answer

- 利用date和row number的差值
- 不是date - row_number 
- 用`date_sub(date,interval row_num day)`



```sql
(select 'succeeded' period_state,
    min(success_date) start_date,
    max(success_date) end_date 
from(
    select success_date,
        row_number() over(order by success_date) row_num
    from Succeeded 
) as s 
where success_date between '2019-01-01' and '2019-12-31'
group by date_sub(success_date,interval row_num day)) #group by date_sub

union all 

(select 'failed' period_state,
    min(fail_date) start_date,
    max(fail_date) end_date 
from(
    select fail_date,
        row_number() over(order by fail_date) row_num
    from Failed
) as f 
where fail_date between '2019-01-01' and '2019-12-31'
group by date_sub(fail_date,interval row_num day)) #group by date_sub

order by start_date

```

### Active Users

Table: Accounts
```
+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| id            | int     |
| name          | varchar |
+---------------+---------+
id is the primary key for this table.
This table contains the account id and the user name of each account.
 
```

Table: Logins
```
+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| id            | int     |
| login_date    | date    |
+---------------+---------+
There is no primary key for this table, it may contain duplicates.
This table contains the account id of the user who logged in and the login date. A user may log in multiple times in the day.
```

Active users are those who logged in to their accounts for five or more consecutive days.

Write an SQL query to find the id and the name of active users.

Return the result table ordered by id.

The query result format is in the following example.

 

Example 1:

```
Input: 
Accounts table:
+----+----------+
| id | name     |
+----+----------+
| 1  | Winston  |
| 7  | Jonathan |
+----+----------+
Logins table:
+----+------------+
| id | login_date |
+----+------------+
| 7  | 2020-05-30 |
| 1  | 2020-05-30 |
| 7  | 2020-05-31 |
| 7  | 2020-06-01 |
| 7  | 2020-06-02 |
| 7  | 2020-06-02 |
| 7  | 2020-06-03 |
| 1  | 2020-06-07 |
| 7  | 2020-06-10 |
+----+------------+
Output: 
+----+----------+
| id | name     |
+----+----------+
| 7  | Jonathan |
+----+----------+
Explanation: 
User Winston with id = 1 logged in 2 times only in 2 different days, so, Winston is not an active user.
User Jonathan with id = 7 logged in 7 times in 6 different days, five of them were consecutive days, so, Jonathan is an active user.
```

### Answer

- 继续用date_sub()
- 注意，有同一天重复登录的情况，这时候应该用dense_rank， 同时distinct

```sql
select distinct
    b.id id,
    name
from(
    select id,
        sub_date,
        count(id) as num
    from(
        select  distinct id, 
        login_date,
        date_sub(login_date, interval dense_rank() over(partition by id order by login_date) DAY) sub_date
    from Logins
    ) as a
    group by id,sub_date
) as b 
left join Accounts a on b.id = a.id 
where num >= 5

```
